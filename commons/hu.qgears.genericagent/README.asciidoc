= Java agent for dynamic class load

This project build a Java-Agent that is capable of launching dynamic code within a JVM:

 * The jar built can be loaded as a Java Agent into a running JVM using the 
   com.sun.tools.attach.VirtualMachine.loadAgent(jarpath, option) API method
 * The option is split by the comma character (',')
 * All but the last two pieces are used as classpath URLs to create a dynamic classloader
   (the parent class loader of this loader will be the system classloader which is typically the one
     that loads the java -jar xxx.jar and the -cp jars)
 * The one before the last piece is the Java class that is loaded through the dynamic classloader and instantiated
   (public no-arg constructor must be present)
 * Last last piece is passed as a parameter to the run method of the class which has to have the prototype:
 
 public void run(String arg);

The useful payload have to be in this method.


In case of Exception the exception is printStackTrace()d to stderr.

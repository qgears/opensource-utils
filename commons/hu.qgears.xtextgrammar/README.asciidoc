= Convert XText languages to QParser infrastrucutre

 * Definition of XText language to parse and process XText grammar.
 * Generate QParser language definition
 * Generate parser that converts QParser tree to EMF objects.

The goal is to convert xtext projects to qgears.parser based re-implementation.

This project does not handle cross references.

Why? Together with hu.qgears.crossref a very well performing implementation is possible with fast initial and incremental build of text based model.
